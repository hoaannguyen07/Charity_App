# Charity_App
A database of different non-profit/charity organizations in the US. 
Helpful for those who want to search for a specific (type of) charity. 
Includes a summary of the organization along with contact information. 
Will use the US Governent's registry of non-profits & charities as a basis.

This project will be done state by state because there isn't a registry of nonprofits throughout the whole US on any government website

Outline of App:
Use Python to parse webpages with lists of nonprofits and charities and record information from it. 
Use SQL to organize that information, which is to be fed to their coresponding spot on the front end.
Since this will stay strictly an iOS app for the time being, Swift will be used for the front end because of the huge library Apple has already provided coders with.
